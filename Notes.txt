Correlation between player returns and mkt returns is extremely weak.
There is too little liquidity such that most players prices don't move across
most days. Therefore the market will always move w/ apparent 0 correlation w/ 
individual players, we may need to use a portfolio of the topX traded players
as a mkt pf. Otherwise were struggling to get results.
